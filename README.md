Three different files doing different things: 

    1) NusseltFunofAngleRen.py) Plots Nusselt # as a function of Angle and Reynolds #; this is the same code used in dataBinner.py; it also generates an HTML file that can be opened using a browser

    2) VelCalcfromHtcAng.py) Calculates velocity[m/s] from angle[deg] and heat transfer coefficient[W/m^2-K] from data using a FluxTeq PHFS-01 heat flux sensor. Populated with data from AngleHtcVel.csv

    3) HtcCalcfromAngVel.py) Calculates heat transfer coefficient[W/m^2-K] from angle[deg] and velocity[m/s] from data using a FluxTeq PHFS-01 heat flux sensor. Populated with data from AngleVelHtc.csv
